# Dynamic Image API

The Dynamic Image API allows you to modify and optimize images in real time with minimal effort. By appending query parameters to your image URIs, you can easily transform, crop, resize, adjust colors, and more—enabling seamless, on-the-fly image manipulation for web pages, applications, and other digital content. The API optimizes images for improved loading times and bandwidth savings.

## What you'll need

Before you dive in, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* An active account
* Dynamic Image API enabled in your settings

## Using the Dynamic Image API

The core principle of the Dynamic Image API is that all transformations are performed on the fly. You simply add parameters to the image's URL, and the service processes these parameters, delivering a transformed output image.

The API supports a wide array of filters and transformations. Common resizing methods include adjusting the width and height while maintaining proportions (you can adjust one dimension at a time—either width or height—and the other will be set as a result). To emphasize particular elements within the frame, you can crop images or use focus cropping to highlight specific areas. Additional options allow for luminosity adjustments, color manipulation, and changes to image geometry, such as flipping, flopping, or rotating. Enhancements like sharpening, gamma correction, saturation, tinting, and contrast adjustments further empower you to refine the final look and feel of your images.

## Common use cases

The Dynamic Image API is frequently used to:
* Generate thumbnails on-the-fly
* Supply multiple resolutions of the same image
* Adjust brightness, contrast, and color
* Blur or sharpen images
* Achieve desired visual styles for any given image or project
